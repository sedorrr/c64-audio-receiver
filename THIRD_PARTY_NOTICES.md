# Third-party notices – C64 Audio Receiver

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (see `LICENSE`), with an additional
permission for the CYW43 WLAN driver (see the section "License" in `README.md`). The firmware files in
`firmware/` are built from this source together with the following third-party components. Their licenses
are reproduced below as they require.

| Component | Used for | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) 2.1.1 | hardware drivers, startup, USB stdio | BSD-3-Clause |
| [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) (submodule of the Pico SDK) | TCP/IP stack | BSD-3-Clause |
| [cyw43-driver](https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver) (submodule of the Pico SDK) | WLAN chip of the Pico 2 W | Raspberry Pi licence (use only with Raspberry Pi semiconductor devices), see below |
| [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) (submodule of the Pico SDK) | USB serial output of the debug firmware | MIT |
| `src/net/dhcpserver.c`, `src/net/dhcpserver.h` from [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) | DHCP server of the own access point | MIT (header kept in the files) |

Only the Pico 2 **W** firmware contains lwIP, cyw43-driver and the DHCP server; TinyUSB is only in the
`_debug` firmware variants that print diagnostics over USB serial.
